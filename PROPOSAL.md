# FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL

## Proposal

Collision Detection Game:
The game will employ a canon that shoot missiles at fallers. The score will decrement if it fails to make a connection and increment if it collides with the faller. The keys are used to manipulate the game and move the canon to the desired position by pressing the left and right arrows. Pressing enter will deploy the missile. The game will start with the fallers descending at a constant rate. The user must manipulate the canon and deploy the faller, score depends on whether or not a collision is made.

## Functionality

* A helicopter moves across the top of a screen, intermediately dropping people as it goes across the screen
* User controls the canon at the bottom of the screen by using arrow keys to manipulate its direction to target the people falling on the screen
* User clicks enter to launch the object at the fallers
* Whenever a collision between the object and the faller happens then the score increases by 10
* Whenever the object misses, then the score decrements by 5
* A special kind of faller increases the score by 15 when a collision occurs
* A special kind of faller decreases the score by 10 when a collision occurs
* If the user misses the target on more than 3 fallers, the game ends
* Four levels, with increasing difficulty in the form of more faller objects, will be implemented
